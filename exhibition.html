                <h3>Cosmology</h3>
                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night
                    sky
                    and
                    what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and
                    galaxies
                    that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>
                <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the
                    latest
                    exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p></div>

            <div><h3>Evolution</h3>

                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do
                    we
                    come
                    from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework
                    for
                    exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
                <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time.
                    You
                    can
                    also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth,
                    the
                    Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p></div>

            <div><h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>

                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                    insights
                    into
                    the great wonders of the tiny world. </p>
                <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks
                    to
                    the
                    growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                    medicine
                    and
                    take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
                    transplant. </p>
                <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
                    animals
                    in
                    the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
                <h3>Robotics and AI</h3>
                <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the
                    future.
                    From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even
                    say
                    hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>
                <h3>Ecology</h3>
                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it
                    becomes
                    that
                    scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
                    planet.</p>
